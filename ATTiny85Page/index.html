		<p>I will soon add downloads to libraries that i have made for the ATTiny85, which include comunications with AT24C32 EEPROM chips, DS3231 Real-Time clock module, MPU6050 Gyro-Accelerometer, and WS2801 individually addressable RGB LEDs</p>
		
		<p> I will alse be adding a tutorial on how to install the micronucleus firmware, and how to directly interface through usb like a digispark (and thus use digiUSB), and one on how to change the fuses using high voltage programming to make the reset pin into a GPIO</p>
